*There are no Rebel specific Land Vehicles*

Need to go fast like Sanic the Hedgehog?  Take a Land Vehicle!  They drive very intuitively, just hop in, press forward (or backward if you're into that) and you'll be speeding through Beggar's Canyon like a Womprat out of the Spice Mines of Kessel.

Imperial Vehicles:

**74-Z Speeder Bike:**  A stylish and stripped down speeder, perfect for chasing down Rebel scum on Forest Moons.  There's even a white cold-weather variant for when you want to blend in on those cold, snowy planets.  Comes standard with a Blaster Cannon up front for all your blasting needs.

**AT-ST:**  A wicked cool walker with dual Laser Cannons and an even wickeder walking animation.  Crush those Rebel scum in style with this quality vehicle.

**AT-AT:**  Nah just kidding, we don't have AT-AT's.

Civilian Vehicles:

**X-38 Landspeeder:**  Do you want to look like a poor farm boy?  Do you spend long nights looking up at 2 suns thinking about the future?  If so, this is the speeder for you.  It's not terribly fast, it's not the prettiest, and the windscreen is too low to do anything except blow wind directly into your face, but it sure is reliable.

**Swoop Speeder:**  Now to be honest, I don't even know where I got this thing from.  I think some scavenger girl came through and left it, who knows, it doesn't matter.  What does matter is that this thing is FAST.  You'll be zipping to and from the farm in no time with this hybrid swoop/landspeeder bike thing.

**Scoot-'Em-Arounds:**  Now these here are fun, fun, fun.  If I could describe what they do in one word, it'd be scoot.  These puppies'll get ya from point A to point B in no time flat.  As far as I know, the Rebels are the only people who have the dang things, I even hear they race them somewhere in one of their secret bases.
