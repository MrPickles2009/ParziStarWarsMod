#Blasters#

*Most Blasters are faction specific, but some are drops, see the lists below for more information.*

*Some of the "Civilian Blasters" are also purchase-able from Quartermasters.*

Blasters are fired using Right-Click when in your hand.  They cannot be fired unless you have Powerpacks in your inventory.  Each Powerpack gives you 10 shots and your blaster will need to cooldown if 15 shots are fired quickly.  Powerpacks can be bought from Merchants in Mos Eisley, or from the 2 faction's respective Quartermasters.

Each increasing tier of blaster has more damage.  Blaster Pistols have the least amount, Blaster Rifles have the standard amount, and Heavy Blaster Rifles have the most.
