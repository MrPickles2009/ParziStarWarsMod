#Holocrons#

****

*There is no difference in a Holocron between being a Jedi and a Sith.  The Holocron given to you by the Jedi Master is also where your Sith powers are stored (if you choose The Dark Side).  There is only 1 Holocron.*

**Holocrons will remain with the player on death.**

*For information on Force Powers, please see the [[ Force Powers ]] page.*

The Holocron is a Jedi/Sith Questline specific item that stores all your Force Power data.  It is given to you by the Jedi Master during the Jedi Questline.  You must keep it in your inventory at all times in order to use your powers.  It will stay with you on death.
