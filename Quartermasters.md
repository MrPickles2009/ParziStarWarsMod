**Quartermasters are fundamentally different in Creative Mode.  All information below this FAQ section on this page refers to interaction with Quartermasters in Survival Mode.  In Creative Mode, Quartermasters will give all items for free, and do not care about Faction Affiliation.**

Quartermasters are basically faction-specific merchants.  You unlock more and more of their goods as your progress through the Questlines, but remember that everything they have **must be bought**.  There is nothing you can get for free from a Quartermaster.  Their items include faction-specific armors, guns, items, and in some cases, Hyperdrives.
