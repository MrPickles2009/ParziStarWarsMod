#Flying Vehicles#

****

*All flying vehicles fire lasers, have Hover Mode, and fly at roughly the same speed save for the exception of the Interceptors*

***HOVER MODE IS DEFAULTED TO ON WHEN FIRST ENTERING A SHIP.***

*The only vehicles will special weapons besides the standard lasers are the X-Wing (Proton Torpedoes), the Y-Wing (Bombs), and the TIE Bomber (Bombs)*

**Yes, we know that the only Hyperdrive equipped TIE in Canon was the Advanced x1.  However, for the sake of play-ability, we have made all TIE Fighters able to change dimensions/use Hyperdrives.**

Flying Vehicles are an integral part of PSWM.  They are used in all of the Questlines and are the means by which you travel to different planets.  They are flown using the standard forward and backward movement keys and are steered using the mouse.  They will remain flying at the speed last registered (think of a throttle with cruise control forever on).

****

Ships are tied to Factions (Rebel and Imperial), and their usage is dependent on your progression through their respective Questlines.  Once the player reaches and completes the 8th Quest, the first ship of that faction is unlocked.  Once unlocked, you must buy the license for that ship from the Quartermaster.  Once you have bought the license, that type of ship is forever usable and flyable by you with no limitations.  The other 3 flying ships are unlocked with the progression through the rest of the Questline.  Again, each ship license must be bought in order to use it.

Ship licenses are kept even through faction changes.  That means that even if you switch factions after purchasing licenses for ships, you will still be able to use those original ships.

You may not fly ships of the other faction while still in your faction.  However, if you 100% complete the Questline of one faction, you are then allowed to fly all the ships of the other faction.  Consider it a perk of being well trained.

The T-16 Skyhopper is not tied to a faction, does not require a license, and is found (not bought) in Large Tatooine Homesteads.  It is the ship the player must use for dimension changes until they progress through a Questline and unlock others.

Hover Mode is a way to take off and land safely in ships by limiting speed.  It defaults to on when entering a ship and is easily turned on and off with the default changeable keybind "U".

****

Special Weapons are available on the X-Wing, Y-Wing, and TIE Bomber.  They are used with the default changeable keybind  "I".  There is a cooldown between uses and no number limit to usage.
