**Stormtrooper:**  The anchor of The Empire's style choices and a favorite of soldiers alike.  This armor will keep you looking sharper and more menacing than any Rancor ever could.  Just don't get so distracted by yourself that you can't aim.

**Scout Trooper:**  A fabulous addition to the line and an instant classic.  With exposed black undersuits and a minimalist armor design, this armor wows in the field.  With a newly redesigned helmet, this armor is sure to stop those Rebel scum.

**Sandtrooper:**  Deliberate distressing and an eye-catching backpack make this the season's choice for casual chic.  No wretched hive of scum of villainy will be able to keep you away, and you're sure to find those droids you've been looking for.

**Snowtrooper:**  Being warm never looked so good.  Full body thermal insulation and a spacious backpack give this piece a sophisticated and elegant look.  Streamlined armor plating and an extended helmet neckline mean that standing out in the snow won't be difficult this season.

**TIE Pilot:**  Black, sleek, dare we say, sensual?  This armor's black lacquer will have you hitting full throttle before you even set foot in a cockpit.  Those Rebel scum are sure to take notice now.

**AT-AT Pilot:**  We took the TIE Pilot armor, made it perfect for the cold, and you know what that did?  Made it look perfect on YOU.  The AT-ST pilots will be green with envy when they see such a glamorous suit.

**AT-ST Pilot:**  Already copied by Dark Helmet's line, this armor is sure to stun.  Minimal armor on the chest and head, with a full visibility helmet, and a newly designed chin strap.  You'll be walking all over the Rebels with this fabulous piece.
