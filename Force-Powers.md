#Force Powers#

****

*Vanilla Minecraft XP is the vessel by which you level up your Force Level.  The leveling for your Force Level is not 1:1 with your Minecraft XP Level though.  Each level is harder to level-up than the last and thus will take longer.  A message is printed to the chat when you level up.*

*Each power uses a different amount of Force XP, and the Force XP bar regenerates naturally over time.  The higher your Force Level, the more Force XP you have available to you, and the quicker it will regenerate.*

*Access the Force Power GUI by pressing the default changeable keybind "V".*

*Individual Force Powers are explained in the in-game GUI and thus will not be elaborated on here.*

*At Level 35 you can make the choice to denounce the Jedi Order and become a Sith.  This option is never presented again nor is it changeable.*
