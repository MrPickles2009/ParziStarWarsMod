The Quest Log is a place to keep track of your progress across the various Quest Trees.  It can be crafted on Earth, and must be crafted before you can travel to any other [[ Planets ]].  It is where a large amount of your in-game data is stored and your data will be lost to you if you lose it.  That means that you will have to restart all Questlines, lose your rank and progress in factions, and re-obtain any and all Hyperdrives.  **In short, DO NOT lose your Quest Log.**

For Questing, the Quest Log stores your progress in a faction.  If you decide to switch factions, all of your data with the original faction will be overwritten.  **You may not be in both the Imperial and Rebel factions simultaneously.  Similarly, you cannot be a Jedi and a Sith simultaneously.  You must pick one of each, but there is always an option to go to the other faction, except from Sith to Jedi.  Picking Sith will make you unable to become a Jedi again.**
