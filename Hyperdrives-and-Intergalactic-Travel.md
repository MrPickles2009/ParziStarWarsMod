#Hyperdrives and Intergalactic Travel#

****

*The Tatooine Hyperdrive is the only Hyperdrive with a crafting recipe.  It is used to get you to Tatooine, where you will then need to buy Hyperdrives in order to change planets.  It is used by pressing Shift+use.*

*Some planets are exclusive to certain Questlines and cannot be traveled to without progressing through them appropriately.*

*You must have a Quest Log in order to change dimensions.*

*Planet traveling does not require Hyperdrives in Creative Mode.*

**BE ADVISED: When switching dimensions in a ship, the ship will not immediately show up, you have to travel ~50ish blocks away and let the chunk unload and then come back in order for it to show up.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN FIX AT THE MOMENT, AND IT IS SOMETHING YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH.  THE MINECRAFT CODE REGARDING LOADING AND UNLOADING OF CHUNKS IS RIGID AND STUPID AND DOESN'T WANT TO COMPLY.**

*See the very bottom of the page for the Tatooine Hyperdrive recipe.*

In order to travel to other [[ Planets ]], you will need a Hyperdrive for the respective planet and a ship.  Hyperdrives can be procured in 2 different ways:  Some Hyperdrives are given to you as part of a Questline, while all other non-quest based Hyperdrives can be bought from the Corellian Merchant in Mos Eisley.

There is a Galactic Map block, but it can not be used to change dimensions.  It does however show the same GUI as the ships do when shift-right-clicked.

**The Hyperdrive GUI**

To access the Hyperdrive GUI, simply shift-right-click on a ship  (you can plot a course when not in the ship, however you must re-open the GUI once in the ship with the default changeable keybind "U" in order to make the jump to hyperspace and change dimensions.)  Just make sure you have the Hyperdrive for your selected planet in your inventory, click Program NavCom, and then click Jump to Lightspeed in order to change dimensions.  The map in the GUI is a fairly accurate recreation of the actual Star Wars universe including correct planet coordinate positions, sector differentiations, and the 5 major trade-routes.  Don't be alarmed by the small ships flying around in the GUI, as they are simply traveling along the aforementioned trade-routes.  **The map also includes the planets that we plan on adding in future updates, but they are not accessible currently and for the sake of spoilers the names of the planets are not included in the GUI.**

In order to see what planet your cursor is on, simply check the top left corner for a small blurb containing the name of the planet and it's affiliation.  Once you see a planet you would like to travel to and have clicked on it to enlarge it (and you have the Hyperdrive for that planet in your inventory), simply click the "Program NavCom" button.  This will plot a course to the planet.  Once you're ready to travel to your selected planet press the "Jump to Lightspeed" button.  This will take you through the Lightspeed animation and take you to your selected planet.

When you are in the enlarged single planet screen, you can read a wealth of information about your selected planet.  A brief outline of the planet, the terrain, and inhabiting species are just a few of the informative categories that are included for the player to read.  You can also see if that planet has an affiliation. *(If it does have an affiliation, you will see ships from that faction circling the planet.  This is just an easy way to see the planetary affiliation quickly)*
