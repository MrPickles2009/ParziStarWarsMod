#Recommended Play Settings and Other Useful Mods#

****

*None of these settings, suggestions and/or mods are required to play PSWM WHATSOEVER.  We just find that some settings and/or utility mods can improve your experience*

****

**Important Information and Suggestions**

* All PSWM mobs will spawn even when your game is on Peaceful.  Yes that even includes the hostile mobs like Tusken Raiders and Wampas.  We highly recommend you play the mod on Peaceful as this will keep you fully engulfed in the PSWM universe without the annoyance of Vanilla Minecraft mobs like Zombies, Slimes, and Enderman.  We also have taken the liberty of not 100% fully lighting every inch of every structure so we can have some what of a mood/aesthetic for different structures.

* The structures we have in-game use a very proprietary and intricate system in order to spawn in-world.  The main thing to know about this is that the first time entering a dimension with large structures will be slow.  **It could take up to 5 minutes to load some of the bigger structures.**  This slow loading will only happen the VERY FIRST time you enter that dimension, all times after will be fast and normal.  Why did we make a system that has a slow first load?  Well here's the deal, if we didn't do it this way then PSWM would have a multi-gigabyte file size.  This system keeps our file size down by an enormous margin and really simplifies some back-end things.

   *So what can you do about initial structure heavy dimension loading?*

   We recommend that when you first start a world, you go ahead and use the Hyperdrives in the creative inventory to travel to each and every planet.  This will get the initial world-load out of the way and make your later trips to those planets quick and easy.  **Do not use the Survival Mode Hypedrive System.  In Creative Mode, you can still Shift-Right-Click without a Quest Log to travel to planets.  If you have a Quest log in your inventory while doing the dimension loading then you will not have to earn/buy the Hyperdrive for that planet the way PSWM intended.  We also recommend turning your render distance down to about 8 chunks, and disabling very resource intensive things like Shaders as this will help the structures load faster.**

   Again, doing this dimension loading is not necessary WHATSOEVER, but it will get rid of the initial world-load so that you can then travel quickly.

**Recommended Play Settings**

* We'd recommend allocating at least 4GB of RAM to Minecraft.  It'll just make things run nicer and make structure loading faster.

**Other Useful Mods We Use**

* [Optifine](http://optifine.net/downloads):  A great visual optimization mod that can help slower computers run Minecraft just a bit better.  It has tons of customization options and tweaks and can make a big difference on some computers.

   **Optifine does however overwrite A LOT of custom rendering we do.  It will make our custom celestial bodies not show up, not show our custom holding position for guns, and does some other smaller rendering changes.**

* [Journey Map](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/journeymap-32274/files): A Fantastic mod which gives you a great looking in-game map in a GUI as well as a minimap.  You can even set waypoints and teleport to them at will.  It also has tons of GUI customization options on what it should show/hide on your map.

* [Tabula](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tabula-minecraft-modeler/files): IChun's modeling mod that we use to make our models.

   **Requires [iChunUtil](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ichunutil/files/2233005) to work**

* [Not Enough Items](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/notenoughitems/files): Utility mod that gives you an easier to use Creative Menu that is also usable in Creative Mode

   **Requires [CodeChickenCore](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/codechickencore/files) to work.**

* [GLSL Shaders Mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286604-shaders-mod-updated-by-karyonix): Shaders are fantastic and make Minecraft look amazing.  We use Shaders for almost every screenshot and video we take/make.

   **Shaders DRASTICALLY reduce your FPS, we only recommend using these if you have a powerful enough computer.  Optifine will not help GLSL Shaders Mod run faster.  Use Shaders at your own risk.**

* [Better Foliage](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/better-foliage): A visual mod that makes all plant-life much much prettier to look at.  Trees get rounded off, grass blocks have a slight 3D grassy top to them, and leaves will fall from trees.  We use this in screenshots/videos too.

   **This mod may sound like it would reduce playability and FPS, but really is not detrimental to performance whatsoever.*

* [WorldEdit](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/worldedit/files): An indispensable tool that allows you to build, change, and otherwise modify blocks quickly, easily, and in-game.  There are tons of neat commands like copy, paste, and rotate.  There are even custom shape/function generators which are all fully customizable.  We use WorldEdit when building all of our structures and it has become a necessity for our team.
