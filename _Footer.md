We have tried to make this mod as canon correct as humanly possible. That being said, some intricate details and features were omitted or reworked to make the mod more playable, or in some cases, plausible in the Minecraft universe. We are just fans of Star Wars and could never possibly know everything about the entire universe and make everything in this mod 100% canon and correct. However, we did make this mod with canonicity in mind, and through long hours of research strongly believe that we have created a good example of a canon Star Wars experience in the Minecraft environment. If we got something really wrong or you have any suggestions, questions, comments, or problems with our mod, please post it as an issue here on our GitHub. Feel free to look at the code, but please contact us is you plan to change anything or add new features. Thank you for playing and we hope you come to enjoy PSWM with each forthcoming release.
